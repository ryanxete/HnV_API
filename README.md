· This view function should be implemented in a way to accept a “type” parameter o Example: " http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/supers?type=hero”
· If a type query parameter is sent to the view function with the value of “hero”, the view function response should be a list of all supers that are associated with the type of “Hero” (Shown in End Result Overview video on portal)
· If a type query parameter is sent to the view function with the value of “villain”, the view function response should be a list of all supers that are associated with the type of “Villain” (Shown in End Result Overview video on portal)
· If no type query parameter is sent, return a custom dictionary response with a “heroes” key set equal to a list of supers of type “Hero” and a “villains” key set equal to a list of supers of type “Villain” (Shown in End Result Overview video on portal)

o Custom_response = {“heroes” = [], “villains” = []} -->
